# Todo Application (MERN Stack)

This Todo application is a comprehensive project developed to explore and solidify concepts in the MERN stack, emphasizing security, efficient state management, type safety, and production-ready practices.

## Goal of the Application

The primary goal of this project is to gain a thorough understanding of building a scalable and secure web application using the MERN stack. It is designed to explore best practices for building real-world applications, including setting up secure authentication, managing data flow efficiently, and enforcing strict type-checking with TypeScript. This application serves as a learning platform for integrating advanced tools and libraries that enhance both developer experience and application performance.

## What I Implemented

- **JWT Authentication**: Implemented JWT-based authentication to securely manage user sessions, ensuring that only authenticated users can access the application and manage their Todos.
- **CRUD Operations**: Enabled full CRUD functionality for Todos, allowing users to create, read, update, and delete tasks seamlessly.
- **Recoil for State Management**: Utilized Recoil to manage state in a granular way by defining atoms, which streamline component rendering and improve React loading efficiency.
- **TypeScript (Strict Mode)**: Converted JavaScript code to TypeScript with strict mode enabled, adding type safety and improving code readability and reliability across both frontend and backend.
- **Zod for Schema Validation**: Integrated Zod to validate data structures on both frontend and backend, ensuring that the data flow is consistent, secure, and free from unexpected data shapes.
- **Process Management with pm2**: Configured pm2 to manage backend processes in production, enhancing the stability and monitoring of server operations.

## What I Learned

- **Authentication and Security**: Gained a deep understanding of secure JWT implementation and best practices for managing authentication tokens, session storage, and user authorization.
- **State Management Precision**: Learned how to effectively manage state with Recoil's atoms and selectors, providing precise control over component re-rendering and data flow in React.
- **Type Safety with TypeScript**: Experienced the benefits of TypeScript in structuring scalable code, catching errors at compile time, and improving code quality with strict mode enabled.
- **Data Validation with Zod**: Learned how to utilize Zod for schema validation, safeguarding the application from invalid data inputs and ensuring data integrity on both frontend and backend.
- **Production Readiness with pm2**: Discovered the advantages of using pm2 to deploy and monitor the backend server, ensuring consistent uptime and simplifying process management.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js (with TypeScript), Recoil for state management, Zod for data validation
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Authentication**: JSON Web Token (JWT)
- **Process Management**: pm2 for handling server processes in production

## Installation and Usage

1. Clone the repository and install dependencies:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/todo-app.git
   cd todo-app
   cd server && npm install
   cd ../client && npm install
   ```

2. Set up environment variables (see [Environment Variables](#environment-variables)) and start both server and client:

   ```bash
   pm2 start server/server.js --name todo-server
   npm start (in client directory)
   ```

3. Visit `http://localhost:3000` to access the app.
